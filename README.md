# Assembly-Language-Projects

This folder contains all the programming assignments from my Assembly Language Programming class in college. The class was dedicated to gaining a basic understanding of how the machine code of the computer's processor interacts with our higher-level programming languages through low-level assembly languages. Implementation of labels, jump commands, and the program stack were heavily utilized later in the class. Several class assignments were given that required us to perform basic coding exercises in Assembly; later in the course, the programming language C was implemented to show how the lower and higher-level languages can be combined to increase functionality.

**Here is a breakdown of each program and its purpose.**

Program 1: Basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division) and swapping two character locations in memory.

Program 2: Looping program that takes user input and determines if that input is a palindrome. Makes use of labels and jump commands to simulate "loops"

Program 3: Combination of C and Assembly to perform several operations:
 - Obtaining two integers from user input in C and adding them together in Assembly
 - Obtaining string input from user in C and determining if it's a palindrome in Assembly
 - Obtaining user input of a number in C, then converting it to an integer and calling a C function to determine the factorial of that number in Assembly
 - Obtaining string input from a user in Assembly and calling a C function to determine if the string is a palindrome

**Also included were some bonus assignments for extra credit purposes:**

bonus2: taking a string as user input and printing the string in reverse <br> bonus3: intro to combining C and Assembly - adding integers in Assembly from parameter input in C </br>
